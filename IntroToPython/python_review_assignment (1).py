#1.  write a statement that will input a persons name
#    and store it in a variable name


#2.  write a statement that will input a person's age as an integer



#3.  repeat steps 1 and 2 three times total saving the input in a different
#    variable each time (a total of three names and ages).



#4.  find the average age of the three people and store it in a 
#    new variable.  (add all three and divide by 3)



#5.   print the statement "the average age of _____, _____, and _____
#    is _____."  each blank should be filled with the appropriate name
#    or the average age that you calculated. Example:  The average age
#    of Jim, Dan, and Joe is 17.33333333333333




#6.  Let's try to apply the mathematical formula for calculating
#    interest.  
#    The formula for interest in math class is A=P*(1+r)**t
#    A is the amount of money that you have at the end of t years
#    P is the principle or, in other words, the starting amount
#    r is the interest rate as a decimal, so 2.4% is 0.024
#    t is the length of time of the investment.  
#    Write a series of statements that will input all necessary 
#    information(everything except A), keeping in mind they are 
#    all numbers and all values can be a decimal.
#    Calculate the amount of money (A) at the end of an investment
#    print the following statement (be sure to round the values
#    representing money to 2 decimals):
#    "After investing _p__ dollars at a rate of __r__ for __t__ years
#    you now have __A__ dollars."



#7.  input your favorite video game as a string and store
#    it into a variable called game


#8.  input the price of that game as a float and store it into a 
#    variable called price


#9.    write a print statement that will say:
#        "___game___:$___price___"  there should be NO SPACES after
#      the semi-colon and price should have 2 decimal spaces
#       no matter what.  You must use the format function on price
#       and sep for print
